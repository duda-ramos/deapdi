  # Fix RLS Policies for All Tables

  1. Security Changes
    - Temporarily disable RLS on all tables for configuration
    - Re-enable with proper policies for profiles table
    - Add comprehensive policies for different user roles

  2. Policies Created
    - Users can manage their own profiles
    - Admins and HR can view all profiles
    - Managers can view their team members
    - Special policy for signup process
