The plan prioritizes critical security and stability issues first, followed by quality assurance, user experience improvements, and finally performance optimization. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation for the next improvements.

With proper execution of this plan, the application will achieve:
- **Security compliance** with no vulnerabilities
- **High quality** with comprehensive testing
- **Excellent user experience** with accessibility compliance
- **Optimal performance** with monitoring and observability
- **Production readiness** with proper deployment and maintenance

The estimated timeline of 8-10 weeks is realistic for a team of 2-3 developers working full-time on these improvements. Regular monitoring and adjustment of the plan will ensure successful completion of all objectives.
